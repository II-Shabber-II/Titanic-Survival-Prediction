# Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) to uncover insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and other factors that may have influenced survival chances.

The aim is to:
- Explore the dataset using **Python & Pandas**
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Visualize patterns and relationships using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- Derive meaningful insights to support further modeling

## 📊 Key Insights
Some highlights from the analysis:
- **Survival rate by gender**: Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- **Class & survival**: Passengers in **1st class** had the highest chance of survival.
- **Age factor**: Younger passengers had a slightly better chance of survival.
